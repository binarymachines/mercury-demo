Pipeline Requirements


read pipe-delimited flat files
canonical record has 10 fields
date records are mm/dd/yyyy (can allow single-digit values for month and day)

valid subscriber status values (input) are: Paid, Lapsed, Suspended

For paid subscribers:

subscriber longevity is the difference between their signup date and [ expiration date or *today*], 
whichever is EARLIER


For lapsed subscribers:

longevity is the difference between their signup date and their expiration date


For suspended subscribers:

the source datasets do not contain the date of their suspension. For now, 
calculate their longevity the same way you would for a paid subscriber.
